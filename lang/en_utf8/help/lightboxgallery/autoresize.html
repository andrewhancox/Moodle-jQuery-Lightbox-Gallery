<h1>Resizing Images</h1>

<p>You can control if and how gallery images are resized. The following methods are available when configuring a gallery:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Screen: images that are bigger than the users screen will be scaled down to fit inside the screen.</li>
  <li>Upload: images will be resized to specified dimensions when they are uploaded through the &quot;Add image&quot; option.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is also an image resizing plugin included in the image editor, where you can manually resize images.</p>
