Moodle Lightbox Gallery v2.2.1 (12th May 09)

 * ABOUT *

This resource allows you to create 'Lightbox' enabled image galleries within your Moodle course.

The javascript heavy lifting is performed by:
    slimbox 2 : http://www.digitalia.be/software/slimbox2
    Jcrop :     http://deepliquid.com/content/Jcrop.html

As a course teacher, you are able to create, edit and delete galleries. The main configuration option
involves telling Moodle which directory contains the images you want to include in the gallery. Small
thumbnails will then be generated, which are used for the thumbnail view of the gallery.

Clicking on any of the thumbnails brings that image into focus, and allows you to scroll through the
gallery at your leisure. Using the Lightbox scripts creates nice transition effects when loading and
scrolling through the images.

This upgrade includes various bug fixes and code enhancements, including fixes to the 'crop' and 'tag'
image editing plugins.

This plugin was designed for Moodle version 1.9 and upwards

 * INSTALLATION / UPGRADING *

For installation/upgrading instructions, see the file install.txt in this archive. After installation
